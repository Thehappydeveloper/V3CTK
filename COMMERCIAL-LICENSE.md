# Commercial Licensing Reference

V3CTK is available under a dual-licensing model:
- GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) for open-source use.
- A separate commercial license for proprietary/closed-source use.

When a commercial license is typically required:
- Embedding V3CTK in proprietary products or services.
- Redistributing V3CTK without complying with GPLv3 obligations.
- Using V3CTK in closed internal workflows where GPLv3 terms are not acceptable.
