# Contributing to V3CTK

Thank you for contributing to V3CTK. This project maintains strict IP and licensing governance to preserve its dual-licensing model.

## Licensing Model

V3CTK is publicly distributed under GPLv3 and also offered under a separate commercial license.

The goal of this policy is to ensure the project authors/maintainers do not lose commercial relicensing eligibility because of third-party contributions.

To preserve that eligibility:
- Do not add terms that restrict relicensing.
- Do not contribute code copied from unknown, proprietary, or license-incompatible sources.
- Keep clear provenance for all non-trivial contributions.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

External contributions require explicit CLA acceptance before merge.

By contributing, you agree that maintainers may request your CLA confirmation in writing (for example, via signed text in PR discussion or email) before merging.

See [CLA.md](CLA.md) for full terms.

Maintainers must not merge external PRs without explicit CLA agreement.

## Dependency and License Compatibility Rules

Before adding a new dependency:
- Confirm license compatibility with GPLv3.
- Do not add AGPL or other restrictive copyleft dependencies unless a maintainer explicitly approves.
- Document the dependency license in the PR description.

If license compatibility is unclear, stop and ask maintainers for explicit approval before proceeding.

## Proprietary / Enterprise Feature Separation

If enterprise or proprietary features are developed:
- Keep them in separate private repositories/branches as directed by maintainers.
- Do not merge proprietary code into the GPLv3 public core.

## Paper vs Software Licensing

Research papers and documentation artifacts may use licenses such as CC-BY.
Software source code in this repository remains governed by GPLv3 (and dual-licensing policy) unless explicitly stated otherwise by maintainers.

## Submission Checklist

When opening a PR, confirm:
- You wrote the code yourself or used license-compatible sources with attribution.
- You have accepted the project CLA (external contributors).
- New dependencies are GPLv3-compatible or explicitly approved.
- No proprietary/enterprise-only code is included in this repository.

Use the pull request template to provide these confirmations.
